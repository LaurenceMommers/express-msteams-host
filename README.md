# Express utility for Microsoft Teams Apps

This utility for [Express](https://expressjs.com/) is targeted for [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/platform/) applications built generated by the [Microsoft Teams Yeoman generator](https://aka.ms/yoteams) hosted on Express.

The Middleware serves two major purposes:

* Automatic routing of web services for Bots, Connectors and Outgoing Webhooks based on TypeScript decorators
* Automatic routing of static pages for Tabs and Connectors

The middleware is automatically added to projects generated by the Microsoft Teams Yeoman generator.

## Usage

For the automatic routing to work the following usage MUST be followed.

### Decorator usage for Bots

Bots MUST be implemented as a class implementing the `IBot` interface and decorated using the `BotDeclaration` decorator.

``` TypeScript
import { BotDeclaration, IBot } from 'express-msteams-host';
import * as teamBuilder from 'botbuilder-teams';

@BotDeclaration(
    '00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000',
    '/api/messages',
    process.env.MICROSOFT_APP_ID,
    process.env.MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD)
export class myBot implements IBot {
    public readonly Connector: teamBuilder.TeamsChatConnector;
    ...
}
```

### Decorator for Connectors

Connectors MUST be implemented as a class implementing the `IConnector` interface and decorated using the `ConnectorDeclaration` decorator.

``` TypeScript
import { ConnectorDeclaration, IConnector } from 'express-msteams-host';


@ConnectorDeclaration(
    '/api/connector/connect',
    '/api/connector/ping',
    'web/myConnectorConnect.ejs',
    '/myConnectorConnected.html'
)
export class myConnector implements IConnector {
    Connect(body: any): void {
        ...
    }

    Ping(): Promise<void>[] {
        ...
    }
}
```

### Decorator for Outgoing Webhooks

Outgoing Webhooks MUST be implemented as a class implementing the `IOutdegoingWebhook` interface and decorated using the `OutgoingWebhookDeclaration` decorator.

``` TypeScript
import { OutgoingWebhookDeclaration, IOutgoingWebhook } from 'express-msteams-host';
import * as express from 'express';

@OutgoingWebhookDeclaration('/api/webhook')
export class myOutgoingWebhook implements IOutgoingWebhook {
    public requestHandler(req: Express.Request, res: Express.Response, next: Express.NextFunction): any {
        ...
    }
}
```
